# Minimalist LyX Template for Academic Papers

This repository contains a [LyX](https://www.lyx.org) template using [LaTeX](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e) to create an academic paper. The template follows the LaTeX original by Pascal Michaillat available [here](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper).

It follows typographical best practices and has a minimalist design. The template is particularly well-suited for research papers. It is designed so papers are comfortable to read and easy to scan, both in print and on screen. 

## Documentation

The original LaTeX template is documented at https://pascalmichaillat.org/a/. Specific to the LyX version is the fact that the file `paper.aux` is necessary for `appendix.lyx` to pick up cross-references from `paper.lyx`. The aux file can be generated easily by running generic LaTeX (not pdfLaTeX) on `paper.tex`.

## Illustration

+ The paper produced by the template can be viewed at https://pascalmichaillat.org/a.pdf.
+ The online appendix produced by the template can be viewed at https://pascalmichaillat.org/aa.pdf.

## Usage

+ Clone the repository to your local machine.
+ Start editing the LyX file `paper.lyx` to replace the boilerplate content with the content of your paper. 
+ Replace the figures in the PDF file `figures.pdf` with the figures to be included in your paper (one figure per page).
+ Replace the references in the BibTeX file `bibliography.bib` with the references to be included in your paper.
+ Compile the document with LyX's default engine. This will generate a PDF file of your paper named `paper.pdf`.
+ The LaTeX style file `paper.sty` formats the paper. It must be included in the same folder as `paper.tex`. It can be modified to alter the paper's format.
+ The BibTeX style file `bibliography.bst` formats the bibliography. As of this first commit, the pdflatex engine that LyX uses produces the following error: 

`You can't pop an empty literal stack for entry M14...`

To avoid this error, the LyX template simply uses the style `chicago`, which produces similar results. 

It can be included in the same folder as `paper.lyx` or added to some of LyX's internal folders. It can be modified to alter the bibliography's format. The style file is based on `econ.bst`, which was created by Shiro Takeda and is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/econ-bst).

+ The file `paper.pdf` is not required to use the template. It only illustrates the output of the template and will be overwritten when `paper.lyx` is compiled.

## Online appendix

The repository also includes files to produce an online appendixâ€”in case the paper's appendix must be carved out into a separate, online appendix upon publication. An online appendix can be produced as follows:

+ Start editing the LyX file `appendix.lyx` to replace the boilerplate content with the content of your online appendix. 
+ The equation and section labels from `paper.tex` can be used in `appendix.tex`. [This requires the following](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/xr):
	+ The file `appendix.tex` is in the same folder as `paper.tex`.
	+ The file `paper.tex` is compiled first.
	+ The auxiliary file `paper.aux` is available when `appendix.tex` is compiled.
+ Compile `appendix.tex` with pdfTeX. This generates a PDF file of your appendix named `appendix.pdf`.
+ The LaTeX style file `appendix.sty` formats the online appendix, in conjunction with `paper.sty`. Both style files must be included in the same folder as `appendix.tex`.
+ The file `appendix.pdf` is not required to use the template. It only illustrates the output of the template and will be overwritten when `appendix.tex` is compiled.

## Submission to arXiv

The template is perfectly compatible with [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). After being compiled with pdfTeX, a paper based on the template can be submitted to arXiv in four steps:

1. Export the LyX file as `pdflatex` by clicking File > Export > LaTeX (pdflatex) and move the exported `paper.tex` into the `arxiv` folder.

2. Adjust the preamble of `paper.tex`. On line 348, replace `\bibliographystyle{bibliography}` by `\pdfoutput=1`. The `\bibliographystyle{bibliography}` command is not needed because arXiv produces the bibliography from the `paper.bbl` file. The `\pdfoutput=1` is required because the paper is compiled with pdfTeX. Also ensure that the *.bib file is removed or else the compilation recipe will attempt to create a new bibliography and produce a fresh, empty *.bbl file.

2. Collect the required files into a folder. There should be four files: the source file `paper.tex`, the bibliography file `paper.bbl`, the style file `paper.sty`, and the figure file `figures.pdf`. 
3. Zip the folder and upload the zipped folder to arXiv.

The `arXiv` folder illustrates how the template should be prepared for submission to arXiv. The folder contains the four required files: `paper.tex`, `paper.bbl`, `paper.sty`, and `figures.pdf`. Furthermore, the preamble of `paper.tex` is adjusted appropriately. After being zipped, the folder could be uploaded to arXiv and would compile properly.

## Software

+ The template was developed with LyX 2.4.3 on macOS. 
+ Other LaTeX distributions and operating systems may require minor adjustments. Please [report any issues to me directly](mailto:jrs89@cam.ac.uk) to help improve compatibility.
